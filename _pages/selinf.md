#### Topics in Selective Inference and Predictive Inference
--- 
###### Description


###### Syllabus 

- Multiple testing: global null, FWER, FDR, local FDR 
- Testing with game-theoretic statistics: e-values 
- Empirical Bayes, Compound decision-making
- Permutation test, Conformal inference 
- Other topics in distribution-free inference (TBD)


###### Grading 
Grading will be determined by a course project.

###### Resources 
The [international seminar on selective inference (ISSI)](https://www.selectiveinferenceseminar.com/) is a weekly online seminar on selective inference 
and related topics. Every week, an invited speaker will give a 45-min talk, followed by a 15-min discussion.
