#### Topics in Selective Inference and Predictive Inference
--- 
###### Description
This PhD course covers topics in selective inference and distribution-free predictive inference. The first half focuses on selective inference, introducing problems and tools in multiple testing, post-selection inference, and adaptive/sequential inference. The second half centers on distribution-free predictive inference, with an emphasis on conformal inference. Throughout, we highlight recent advances, practical considerations, and open problems in both areas. 

###### Syllabus 

- Multiple testing: global null, FWER, FDR, local FDR 
- Post-selection inference, sequential testing 
- Testing with e-values 
- Empirical Bayes, Compound decision-making
- Permutation test, Conformal inference 
- Distribution-free predictive inference


###### Grading 
Grade will be based on a course project. Each student is expected 
to complete a research project that is related in some way to the themes 
and topics of the course. Projects may be theoretical or empirical 
(ideally a mix of both), and  
students are encouraged to build on or connect to their thesis research.
The instructor will meet with students individually to discuss project ideas 
and provide feedback on progress throughout the semester. The grading components are:

- 10% - Proposal (due **Feb 16, 2026**): Submit a short report (no more than 1 page) stating the research problems that you plan to work on. Describe why they are important or interesting and provide some appropriate references.
-	10% - Progress report (due **Mar 23, 2026**): Submit a progress report (no more than 3 pages) summarizing what you have completed so far, any preliminary results, and your updated plan for the remainder of the project.
-	40% - Final presentation (in class): Give an in-class presentation on your project, outlining the problem, approach, main findings, and takeaways. Final timing may be adjusted depending on enrollment.
-	40% - Final report (due **May 4, 2026**): Submit a final project report summarizing your goals, methodology, main results, and conclusions. Discuss limitations and possible next steps. Include complete references and, when relevant, provide a link to reproducible code and data
