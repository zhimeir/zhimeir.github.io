#### Topics in Selective Inference and Predictive Inference
--- 

###### Syllabus 

- Multiple testing: global null, FWER, FDR 
- Testing with game-theoretic statistics: e-values 
- Competition-based testing 
- Compound decision-making
- Conformal inference 


###### Reading 
The following references are related to the topics covered in the class.

- Large-Scale Inference: Empirical Bayes Methods for Estimation, Testing, and Prediction. *B. Efron, IMS Monographs*.
- [Hypothesis Testing with E-values](https://sas.uwaterloo.ca/~wang/files/e-book-final.pdf). *A. Ramdas and R. Wang, Foundations and Trends in Statistics*.

###### Resources 
The [international seminar on selective inference (ISSI)](https://www.selectiveinferenceseminar.com/) is a weekly online seminar on selective inference 
and related topics. Every week, an invited speaker will give a 45-min talk, followed by a 15-min discussion.
