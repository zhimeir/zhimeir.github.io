<p style="font-size: 15px; font-weight:400;">Welcome to my homepage!</p>

<br/>

<p style="font-size:15px; font-weight:400;">
I am an assistant professor in the <a href='https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/'>Department of Statistics and Data Science</a> at the Wharton School, <a href='https://www.upenn.edu/'>University of Pennsylvania</a>. 
</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; font-weight:400;">
From 2021-2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Statistics Department at the University of Chicago, 
advised by Professor <a href='https://rinafb.github.io/'>Rina Foygel Barber</a>. 
I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from Stanford University, advised by Professor <a href='https://candes.su.domains/'>Emmanuel Candès</a>. 
Prior to this, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from Peking University. Here is a copy of my <a href='/assets/pdf/CV_Zhimei_Ren.pdf'>CV</a>.
You can also find me on <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X3gGi_0AAAAJ&hl=en'>Google scholar</a> and <a href='https://github.com/zhimeir'>GitHub</a>.
